//TODO:: Phase 1 is still to be implemented.
Phase 1 - Register Controller on the LEV

1. Controller sends JSON request for registering.
   Payload: {"controllerId" : controllerUUID, "controllerType" : "iOS device"}

2. LEV Registers the controller in the config.json file.
   // TODO:: in the future we should have a controller manager.
   // A user should be able to ban/remove registered controllers.
   // A user should be able to choose if a new controller is allowed to be registered.

Phase 2 - Manage Connected Controllers

#IF a controller is already active
1. Don't listen to any other controller drive commands but the one that is already active.

#IF no controller is active yet.
1. Listen for a "enable controller as active" request.
2. Enable the listening of the active controller ONLY
3. Stop listening to drivingCommands the active controller once the active controller sends a "disable controller as active" command
4. Listen for a "enable controller as active" request.
